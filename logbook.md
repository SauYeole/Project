### Project Logbook: NGO Management System
# Week 1: 24/02/2025 – 08/03/2025
The first week marked the official commencement of the NGO Management System project. The team conducted initial brainstorming sessions to finalize the project topic and scope. After careful consideration, the problem statement was clearly identified: many NGOs struggle to efficiently manage their donors, volunteers, funding, and events due to the absence of a centralized and digital platform. Currently, most NGOs rely on manual methods such as paper records or Excel sheets, which are inefficient, prone to errors, and lack transparency. Recognizing these pain points, the team defined several key objectives for the project. These included building a dynamic, responsive web application capable of securely maintaining donor information and donation history, coordinating volunteer details and task assignments, tracking ongoing events and projects in real time, and offering an administrative dashboard for analytics and control. Additionally, we aimed to ensure data security and implement user role-based access control to protect sensitive information. The team also explored the broader applications of the system, including enhancing NGO operations management, facilitating donor engagement for fundraising, supporting CSR initiatives, and promoting transparency through social audits. By the end of this week, the project proposal was documented with clear goals and timelines, and responsibilities were assigned among team members to set a structured foundation for the subsequent phases.

# Week 2: 10/03/2025 – 22/03/2025
During the second week, our primary focus was on conducting an in-depth background study and understanding the existing landscape of NGO management solutions. We began by analyzing traditional processes widely used by NGOs, including manual record keeping, offline donation tracking, and use of spreadsheets. These methods revealed significant limitations in terms of scalability, real-time access, and error management. We also examined several commercial donor management tools such as DonorBox, GiveWP, and Blackbaud. While these platforms provide advanced features, they often fall short in customization options, can be costly, and may not meet the specific needs of small to medium-sized NGOs. To gain academic insights, we reviewed relevant research papers, particularly focusing on Kumar and Sharma’s 2022 study on web-based NGO information systems, which emphasized the importance of centralized, secure, and user-friendly solutions. Based on these findings, the team documented both functional requirements (like donor registration, volunteer coordination, event scheduling, and reporting) and non-functional requirements (including security, scalability, and accessibility). This research phase was critical in shaping a clear, technology-agnostic blueprint for our system and informed decisions on choosing appropriate tools and methodologies in the upcoming design and development stages.

# Week 3: 24/03/2025 – 05/04/2025
In Week 3, the team transitioned into system design and technology selection. After evaluating various options, we finalized our technology stack as follows: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for developing a modern, responsive frontend interface that ensures seamless usability across devices; PHP 8.0 for backend logic due to its robust support and compatibility with the chosen web server environment; and MySQL for reliable and scalable data storage. We created a detailed system architecture block diagram illustrating the interaction between end-users, frontend UI, backend processing, and the database. This diagram provided a visual overview of data flow and modular system components, including donor management, volunteer coordination, event tracking, and the admin control panel. Alongside architecture design, we drafted algorithms for key functions such as user authentication (validating credentials and managing sessions), fund management (handling donations, validating inputs, and generating reports), and volunteer task assignment (allocating responsibilities and tracking progress). Furthermore, we identified the need for an analytics component and decided on Power BI for data visualization, aiming to create dashboards that highlight donor trends, fund usage, and volunteer activity over time. To support development and testing, the team created a synthetic dataset with over 200 donors, 50 volunteers, and 15 scheduled events, ensuring realistic and comprehensive test coverage for the system’s functionality.

# Week 4: 07/04/2025 – 26/04/2025
During the fourth week, the core development of the system modules was carried out. The Donor and Fund Management module was designed to facilitate adding and editing donor profiles, tracking donations, and generating official receipts. We incorporated form validation and security features such as SQL injection prevention to safeguard the system. The module also supports exporting transaction data to CSV files for offline analysis. Parallelly, the Volunteer Coordination module was implemented to register volunteers, capture their contact details and skillsets, assign tasks, and monitor task status through a calendar interface. Special attention was given to role assignments and enabling volunteers to view their responsibilities easily. The Project and Event Tracker module allowed creation and scheduling of events or projects, team assignments, and progress monitoring through status updates and conflict detection to avoid overlapping events. The Admin Panel was developed as a central control interface, equipped with dashboards displaying key metrics and audit logs to track user activities. Comprehensive testing was undertaken for each module focusing on CRUD operations, validation checks, access control, and ensuring proper error handling. Screenshots documenting module interfaces and testing results were collected to assist with project reporting.

# Week 5: 28/04/2025 – 03/05/2025
In the final week of the project, evaluation and documentation efforts were prioritized. The system was tested extensively using the manually generated dummy dataset, simulating real-world NGO scenarios. Performance tests were conducted both on the local machine and across a local area network to verify scalability and responsiveness. Using Power BI, multiple interactive dashboards were created to visualize critical data such as monthly donor contribution trends, fund allocation versus utilization, and volunteer engagement over time. These visualizations demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in providing actionable insights to NGO administrators. The team compiled the final project report, detailing each module’s functionality, testing procedures, and results. The report included screenshots, diagrams, and links to the GitHub repository containing source code and documentation. Additionally, future enhancement plans were proposed, including cloud-based deployment for remote accessibility and mobile application development to extend platform reach. These extensions are slated for subsequent academic semesters, ensuring the system remains scalable and adaptable to evolving NGO needs.
